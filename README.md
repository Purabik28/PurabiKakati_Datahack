This project focuses on predicting individuals' probabilities of receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines using machine learning techniques. It involves initial data preparation, addressing missing values, exploring data trends, creating new features, and applying multiple algorithms for modeling. Ultimately, the models generate forecasts of vaccine uptake probabilities for both xyz and seasonal flu vaccinations.
